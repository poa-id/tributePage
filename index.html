        <p class="responsive-text">Franklin Patrick Herbert Jr. (October 8, 1920 â€“ February 11, 1986) was an American
          science-fiction author
          best known for the 1965 novel Dune and its five sequels. Though he became famous for his novels, he also wrote
          short stories and worked as a newspaper journalist, photographer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and
          lecturer.</p>

        <p class="responsive-text">The Dune saga, set in the distant future, and taking place over millennia, explores
          complex themes, such as
          the long-term survival of the human species, human evolution, planetary science and ecology, and the
          intersection of religion, politics, economics and power in a future where humanity has long since developed
          interstellar travel and settled many thousands of worlds. Dune is the best-selling science fiction novel of
          all time, and the whole series is widely considered to be among the classics of the genre.</p>

      <h3 class="responsive-titles">Interesting Facts</h3>
      <a id="nav-target-facts" class="link"></a>
      <ul>
        <li>Herbert began researching Dune in 1959. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career
          because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the
          breadwinner during the 1960s.</li>
        <li>Dune took six years of research and writing to complete and it was much longer than commercial science
          fiction of the time was supposed to be.</li>
        <li>It was then rejected by nearly twenty book publishers. One editor prophetically wrote, "I might be making
          the mistake of the decade, but ...".</li>
        <li>Dune was the first major ecological science fiction novel, embracing a multitude of sweeping, interrelated
          themes and multiple character viewpoints, a method that ran through all Herbert's mature work.</li>
        <li>He worked in Vietnam and Pakistan as a social and ecological consultant in 1972. In 1973 he was
          director-photographer of the television show The Tillers.</li>
        <li>Herbert was a strong critic of the Soviet Union. He was a distant relative of the Republican senator Joseph
          McCarthy, whom he referred to as "Cousin Joe".</li>
        <li>He died of a massive pulmonary embolism while recovering from surgery for pancreatic cancer on February 11,
          1986, in Madison, Wisconsin, age 65.</li>
